use log RV in all cases
-MSE, QL for test sample.

method 0; growing window, skip first 100 data		
		-plot of mse vs k
		-table of mse vs k, give excel file or csv
		-all currencies on one ln(SE) plot
method 1; rolling fixed window. 100 window size
		-optimize window size. 100 200 300, 400
		-plot mse vs k
		-table of mse vs k
method 2: do it. Standardize t. Try standardizing sigma
		-plot of mse vs k
		-table of mse vs k
method 3: dont do it

method 4: exact as method 2, high is highest price and lowest price for a day
third; growing window, skip 100 and time penalty
     3d plot need plot of MSE vs k vs time penalty. We have two parameters k and m
whatever extension model is applied to log(RV). normalize time
we have to do standardization
